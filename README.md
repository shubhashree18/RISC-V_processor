# Single_cycle_RISC-V_processor

A Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor is a simplified, yet highly efficient microprocessor architecture that executes instructions in a single clock cycle. It uses one clock-period per instruction and the clock-period is set by the total delay of the slowest instruction.

#### Single_cycle_RISC-V_processor

An implementation that includes a subset of the core RISC-V instruction set:
* ▪ Memory reference instructions: load word (lw) and store word (sw)
* ▪ The arithmetic-logical instructions : add, sub, and, and or
* ▪ The conditional branch instruction: branch if equal (beq)
