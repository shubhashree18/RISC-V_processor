This repository contains the implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog. The processor supports a subset of the RISC-V ISA and is designed for simplicity and educational purposes. The design focuses on understanding the basic operation of a RISC-V processor and how instruction execution, memory interaction, and data flow are managed in a single cycle.

### Single_cycle_RISC-V_processor

A Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor is a simplified, yet highly efficient microprocessor architecture that executes instructions in a single clock cycle. It uses one clock-period per instruction and the clock-period is set by the total delay of the slowest instruction.
